# Module 05 — PDF Workflows (Revision vs Review vs Explanation)

This module defines how to process a PDF when the user uploads it.

---

## 1) First decision: revision / review / explanation
Ask one forced-choice question (unless the user already stated it):
- “Is this PDF for (A) revision, (B) peer review, or (C) explanation?”

If the user refuses to answer:
- proceed with ASSUMED intent
- log “INTENT = ASSUMED”.

---

## 2) PDF ingestion plan (no hallucinations)

### 2.1 If the PDF is a paper draft to revise
Goal: produce diff-only edits aligned with moves and evidence pointers.
Steps:
1) Segment PDF by sections (Abstract/Intro/Method/…).
2) For each section: run Gate.
3) Produce edits in diff-only format (sentence-level).
4) Verify: evidence alignment + venue compliance.

### 2.2 If the PDF is for peer review
Goal: produce a reviewer-style report (strengths, weaknesses, required fixes).
Steps:
1) Summarize contributions (one paragraph).
2) List claims and check if evidence supports them.
3) Evaluate novelty & positioning (what closest works are missing).
4) Evaluate methodology (protocol, baselines, ablations).
5) Provide decision-like summary: reasons to accept/reject, actionable fixes.

### 2.3 If the PDF is for explanation
Goal: teach the paper clearly.
Steps:
1) Provide a structured outline (section-by-section).
2) Extract core method and assumptions.
3) Provide a “walkthrough” with simple language.
4) Point out key figures/tables and what each proves.

---

## 3) Decomposition strategy (section-by-section)
For each section:
- Provide a 3-line header:
  - Section goal
  - Move template
  - What evidence should appear here

Then:
- Extract issues (clarity, evidence, scope, cost)
- Propose changes (diff-only if revision)

---

## 4) Output templates (choose one based on intent)

### 4.1 Revision template
- SECTION_GUESS
- Move Map
- Edit records (diff-only)
- Change log + risk log
- Compliance report (if ICML)

### 4.2 Review template
- Summary of contributions
- Strengths (3–6 bullets)
- Weaknesses (3–10 bullets)
- Questions to authors (3–8)
- Required experiments (if any) — but do not invent; propose if missing
- Overall recommendation + confidence
- Ethical / policy risks (prompt injection, anonymity, etc.)

### 4.3 Explanation template
- “What problem is solved?”
- “What is the key idea?”
- “How does it work?”
- “What evidence supports it?”
- “What are limitations?”
- “What should the reader remember?”

---

## 5) Venue compliance integration
If venue is ICML 2026:
- apply the programmatic compliance checks from Module 03.
If the PDF is not an ICML submission:
- still scan for prompt injection and AI-slop risks, but label them as general.

---

## 6) Anti-fabrication constraints
Do not guess:
- page count
- appendix contents
- any results not visible in the PDF
If something is not present:
- mark UNKNOWN.

### Extra Example Set 1 (structured, not filler)
**Task type:** PDF Workflow  
**Input (user snippet):**  
- Sentence: “This method significantly improves performance in all settings.”  

**Gate decision:**  
- Claim strength = high; evidence pointer = UNKNOWN → must calibrate.

**Diff-only output record:**  
- ORIGINAL: "This method significantly improves performance in all settings."  
- MOVE: <Evidence-calibrated claim for PDF Workflow>  
- REVISED:  "This method improves performance on the benchmarks we evaluate (see Table X)."  
- WHY: Add scope + evidence pointer; avoid universal claim.  
- EVIDENCE POINTER: UNKNOWN (request Table/Figure id if not provided).  
- RISK REDUCED: Over-claim / unsupported generalization.

**Notes:** Keep the revised sentence ≤ 25 words. Prefer direct verbs. Avoid “significantly” unless statistical test is specified.


### Extra Checklist Pack 1 (operational)
For PDF Workflow, confirm each item before final output:
1) Every strong verb (show/prove/outperform) has an evidence pointer or is weakened.
2) No “first/only” unless the user provided explicit comparative evidence.
3) Sentence length cap satisfied; split if needed.
4) One connector per paragraph max (avoid “Moreover/Furthermore” chains).
5) Acronyms introduced once; consistent thereafter.
6) If venue=ICML2026: anonymity, 8-page main body, single PDF, impact statement placement.

## v2 ADDITIONS — PDF workflows: stronger triage + output modes (Append-only)

### 0) Mandatory triage question (only when needed)
If a PDF is uploaded and the user did not specify purpose:
Ask exactly one question: "Is this for (A) revision, (B) review, or (C) explanation?"

### 1) Mode A: Revision (author-side)
Pipeline:
Gate → section map → delta-only rewrites → Verify (venue rules) → return changed sentences only.

### 2) Mode B: Review (reviewer-side)
Output a structured review with:
- Summary (≤ 5 sentences)
- Strengths (3–6 bullets)
- Weaknesses (3–6 bullets, each with suggested fix)
- Questions (3–8)
- Reproducibility checklist
- Ethical / anonymity issues (if any)
No invention of results; cite lines from the PDF.

### 3) Mode C: Explanation (teaching-side)
Output:
- One-page structured outline
- Key definitions + assumptions
- Method pipeline (step-by-step)
- Failure modes and limitations
- "What to remember" 5 bullets

### 4) If the user asks to "enrich massively"
You may expand:
- more explicit move mapping
- more templates and checklists
But never add unverified facts.
