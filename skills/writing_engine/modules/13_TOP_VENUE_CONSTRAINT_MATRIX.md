# Module 13 — Top ML Venue Constraint Matrix (VERIFIED where possible)

Date generated: 2026-01-30

This module provides a compact, cross-venue checklist so the Gate and Verify stages can enforce rules consistently.

**Source priority:** Official sites first. If OpenReview pages are unreadable (JS), treat them as UNVERIFIED.

---

## 1) ICML 2026 (VERIFIED)
- Submission platform: OpenReview (official site links to it).
- Main body: 8 pages max (strict); references/appendix unlimited; single PDF.
- File size: submission ≤ 50MB; camera-ready ≤ 20MB.
- Double-blind; identity leaks → rejection.
- GenAI: allowed, but authors responsible; LLM not authors; prompt injection forbidden; lay summary required for accepted papers.

Sources (VERIFIED):
- https://icml.cc/Conferences/2026/AuthorInstructions
- https://icml.cc/Conferences/2026/CallForPapers

## 2) NeurIPS 2025 (VERIFIED; transfer to NeurIPS 2026+ requires re-check)
- Submission platform: OpenReview.
- Mandatory abstract deadline; placeholder abstract risk removal.
- Single PDF; include paper + references + checklist (suggested order).
- Main text: 9 content pages; refs/checklist/appendices not counted.
- Camera-ready: +1 content page allowed.
- File size: max 50MB.
- Must use official LaTeX style; violations may be rejected.
- LLM policy: allowed; authors responsible; disclose if part of methodology; LLM not authors.

Sources (VERIFIED):
- https://nips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers
- https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM

## 3) ICLR 2026 (VERIFIED)
- Main text: 9 pages at submission; 10 pages at rebuttal/camera-ready; refs excluded.
- Double-blind; identity leaks → desk rejection.
- LLM usage must be disclosed (official policy blog).

Sources (VERIFIED):
- https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2026/AuthorGuide
- https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/08/26/policies-on-large-language-model-usage-at-iclr-2026/

---

## 4) What remains UNVERIFIED (by design)
- Any OpenReview-only details that cannot be read without JS rendering.
- Any future-year rules not yet published on official sites.

## v4 ADDITIONS — Common pitfalls & minimal compliance actions (Append-only)

### Pitfall P1: Placeholder abstract rewrites
ICML 2026 and NeurIPS 2025 both warn that placeholder abstracts substantially rewritten can risk removal.
Minimal action: keep abstract substance stable; apply only clarity edits after abstract deadline.

### Pitfall P2: Anonymity leaks via URLs and repositories
Minimal action: replace with “will be released upon acceptance” and keep private during review.

### Pitfall P3: Page limit misinterpretation
NeurIPS uses “content pages” counting figures/tables; refs/checklist/appendix excluded.
Minimal action: check where figures land; move non-essential material to appendix after refs.

### Pitfall P4: LLM policy conflicts across venues
ICLR 2026 requires disclosure; ICML/NeurIPS have nuanced guidance.
Minimal action: prepare a small disclosure note template and enable it only when required.

### Pitfall P5: Policy-adjacent “style optimization” that becomes evasion
Minimal action: treat style module as clarity improvement, not detection evasion.
