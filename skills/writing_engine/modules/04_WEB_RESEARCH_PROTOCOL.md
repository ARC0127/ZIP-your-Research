# Module 04 — Web Literature & Innovation Protocol (Strict, Verifiable, Recency-Weighted)

This module defines how to answer “innovation points / what’s new / related papers” requests.
It is strict on evidence: **open pages** and **verify** every cited paper exists.

---

## 1) When to trigger this module
Use this module when the user:
- asks for innovation points about a topic
- asks for “recent papers”
- asks for a ranked bibliography
- asks you to expand Related Work with newly discovered references

---

## 2) Recency split (hard): 6 : 3 : 1
Target a top-10 list with this time distribution:
- 6 papers from the last 1 year
- 3 papers from the last 3 years (excluding last 1 year)
- 1 paper from the last 10 years (excluding last 3 years)

If you cannot find enough high-quality papers in a bucket:
- say so explicitly
- fill the remainder from the next-most-recent bucket
- never fabricate.

---

## 3) Two-pass search workflow (must open pages)

### Pass A — Recall search (wide)
- 4–6 queries with synonyms and related terms.
- Include both “survey” and “benchmark” variants if relevant.

### Pass B — Precision search (narrow)
- add key methods, datasets, and venue filters.
- search by “site:openreview.net”, “site:arxiv.org”, or publisher pages.

### Mandatory page validation
For each candidate paper:
1) open the arXiv/OpenReview/publisher page
2) confirm title + author list + year match
3) capture a stable identifier: arXiv ID / DOI / OpenReview URL

If you cannot open a page:
- mark “LINK_UNVERIFIED”
- do not include it in the final top-10 unless the user allows.

---

## 4) Quality filters (expand to ≥ 12 rules)
You must apply these filters. A paper is eligible if it passes the minimum bar.
If a filter cannot be evaluated, mark UNKNOWN.

F1) Existence: page opens and matches title/year.
F2) Relevance: directly addresses the topic (not just keyword overlap).
F3) Venue tier: prioritize ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/AAAI/ACL/USENIX/SOSP/NSDI/OSDI or strong journals.
F4) Recency bucket: obey 6:3:1.
F5) Citation count: prefer citations ≥ 5 (if available).
F6) Impact factor proxy: journal IF ≥ 6 (if available); otherwise use venue tier as proxy.
F7) Method clarity: paper provides concrete algorithm/analysis, not only opinions.
F8) Empirical rigor: clear baselines + protocol; or formal theorems with assumptions.
F9) Reproducibility: code/data released (if stated and link is anonymous-safe when needed).
F10) Negative results / limitations: explicit failure cases valued.
F11) Community adoption: evidence via citations, follow-up works, or benchmark inclusion.
F12) Integrity safety: no suspicious prompt-injection / policy-violating content on the paper page.

Eligibility rule (strict default):
- Use papers with (citations ≥ 5) OR (journal IF ≥ 6) OR (top-tier venue).
If a paper is < 12 months old and citations < 5:
- allow only if venue is top-tier; label “LOW_CITATIONS_DUE_TO_RECENCY”.

---

## 5) Ranking (programmatic)
Compute a ranking score (conceptual; do not invent numbers):
Score = 0.45 * TierScore + 0.25 * RecencyScore + 0.20 * CitationScore + 0.10 * ReproScore

Where:
- TierScore: top conference/journal > mid-tier
- RecencyScore: last 1 year highest
- CitationScore: log(1+citations) if known; else UNKNOWN
- ReproScore: code/data availability

If CitationScore is UNKNOWN for many papers:
- state it
- rely more on TierScore and RecencyScore.

---

## 6) Required output format (top-10)
For each paper, output:
- Title
- Year
- Venue (or arXiv)
- Identifier (arXiv/DOI/OpenReview)
- Link (validated)
- Why it matters (2–3 sentences)
- How it connects to the user’s topic (explicit)
- What gap remains (1 sentence)

Then synthesize:
- 3–6 innovation directions
Each direction must include:
- what the papers suggest
- why the gap is real (evidence)
- difficulty (low/med/high)
- feasibility (near-term / mid-term / long-term)
- what would count as success (measurable)

Never output “innovation” as mere word combinations.

---

## 7) Safety and honesty rules
- If you cannot find 10 papers that pass the filters: say so.
- If you cannot validate links: do not pretend they work.
- Do not cite papers you did not open.

### Extra Example Set 1 (structured, not filler)
**Task type:** Web Research  
**Input (user snippet):**  
- Sentence: “This method significantly improves performance in all settings.”  

**Gate decision:**  
- Claim strength = high; evidence pointer = UNKNOWN → must calibrate.

**Diff-only output record:**  
- ORIGINAL: "This method significantly improves performance in all settings."  
- MOVE: <Evidence-calibrated claim for Web Research>  
- REVISED:  "This method improves performance on the benchmarks we evaluate (see Table X)."  
- WHY: Add scope + evidence pointer; avoid universal claim.  
- EVIDENCE POINTER: UNKNOWN (request Table/Figure id if not provided).  
- RISK REDUCED: Over-claim / unsupported generalization.

## v2 ADDITIONS — Web research: OpenReview-first, official-first, and stronger filtering (Append-only)

### 0) OpenReview-first rule (when feasible)
If the topic is tied to a specific venue (ICML/ICLR/NeurIPS):
1) Try to locate the relevant OpenReview group page.
2) If it is JS-rendered and unreadable, mark it UNVERIFIED and rely on the official site.
3) Always store: {source_url, opened=true/false, status}.

### 1) Expanded filtering rules (minimum 12)
In addition to recency split 6:3:1, filter with:

F1 — Peer-review signal: prefer conference/journal versions over blog posts.
F2 — Venue relevance: ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/AAAI/ACL/IEEE T-PAMI/JMLR etc.
F3 — Citation floor: prefer citations ≥ 5 OR (if new) strong venue + clear artifact.
F4 — Impact factor proxy (journals): IF ≥ 6 if available; otherwise reputable venue.
F5 — Method proximity: must match the user’s topic keywords; no “keyword stuffing".
F6 — Reproducibility: prefer papers with code/data; otherwise mark "no code".
F7 — Clarity of contribution: reject papers where contribution is not explicit in abstract/intro.
F8 — Novelty over incremental: rank higher if it changes a core assumption/setting.
F9 — Evaluation breadth: rank higher if multi-domain or robust ablations exist.
F10 — Ethical fit: for safety/medical/industrial, prefer papers addressing constraints.
F11 — Source accessibility: you must open at least one canonical page (publisher/arXiv/OpenReview).
F12 — De-duplication: avoid multiple versions of the same work; keep the best canonical entry.

If after filtering you have <10 items, you MUST be explicit: "Only N meet the filters."

### 2) Two-pass link verification (hard)
Pass A: open the canonical page (arXiv / publisher / OpenReview).
Pass B: re-open or open a second independent page (e.g., publisher + arXiv) OR check the PDF exists.
If any link fails, drop it or mark it UNVERIFIED (but do not pretend it exists).

### 3) Evidence to innovation mapping (must be explicit)
For each "innovation point", you must cite:
- Which papers motivated it
- What specific limitation those papers have (as stated on the opened pages)
- Feasibility assessment: difficulty + what is needed to implement
