## 3) Patch style (diff-first, minimal)

- Prefer **small diffs** over new files.
- If new files are required: state why, and state delete/merge plan.
- Output MUST be copy/paste-ready:
  - either unified diff blocks, or
  - full file replacements with file paths.

Always include:
- modified files list
- new files list
- risk list (runtime, serialization, config)
