# Evidence & Citation Policy (v1.3.2)

## Non‑negotiables
- No fabrication.
- If uncertain, mark UNKNOWN and propose verification steps.
- Separate facts vs hypotheses vs assumptions.
- Cite or tag sources when provided by the user; do not invent sources.

## Minimal Evidence Standard
For each key claim, include:
- Evidence (what supports it)
- Confidence (High/Medium/Low)
- Risk if wrong

## Unknown Handling
If a required fact is missing:
1) Mark UNKNOWN
2) List what would verify it
3) Provide the next best decision-oriented action

## v1.3.2 Expansion: evidence tiers and citation hygiene

### Evidence tiers (use in outputs)
- **VERIFIED**: backed by provided source text or an explicit citation link.
- **PLAUSIBLE**: reasonable inference from provided evidence; state assumptions.
- **UNKNOWN**: cannot verify; propose a concrete verification plan.

### Citation hygiene (when sources are required)
- Prefer primary sources (papers, official docs).
- Record: title, author, venue/year, and why it supports the claim.
- Avoid cherry-picking: if sources disagree, present both and explain.
