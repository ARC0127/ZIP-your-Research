# WF-PREREG (Preregistration / Pre-analysis Plan)

## Goal
Turn an idea into a **time-bounded, falsifiable plan** that separates confirmatory vs exploratory work.

## Inputs
- Research question + hypothesis
- Primary outcome(s) / metrics
- Data source(s) / simulation env
- Constraints (time, compute, safety)

## Outputs (copy/paste-ready)
1) Preregistration draft (OSF-ready)
2) Pre-analysis plan (stat + decision rules)
3) Verification record (UNKNOWN items + how to verify)

## Steps (recommended skill chain)
1) Problem framing + claim map: S2xx (existing)
2) Prereg builder: S236
3) Pre-analysis plan builder: S336
4) Experiment 2-hour plan: S3xx (existing)
5) Reporting language risk lint: S527

## Acceptance criteria
- Each hypothesis has a measurable test
- Decision rules specified (stop/accept/reject)
- Exploratory analyses labeled explicitly
