# Skill Authoring Guide (v1.0.1)

## Philosophy
A good skill is:
- copy/paste ready
- decision-oriented (2-hour deliverable by default)
- explicit about UNKNOWNs and verification
- testable via an Output Contract and a rubric

## Required sections
1) YAML front matter (id, name, category, triggers, inputs_required, outputs_required, quality_gates)
2) Role
3) Input template
4) Output Contract
5) Policy (no fabrication; UNKNOWN)
6) Example (at least one)

## Rubric (recommended)
Add a short rubric at the end:
- correctness
- evidence quality
- completeness vs contract
- clarity
- actionability

## Naming and IDs
- Use segmented IDs: S2xx / S3xx / S4xx / S5xx
- Do not require continuous numbering.
