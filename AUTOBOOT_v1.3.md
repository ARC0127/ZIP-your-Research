# AUTOBOOT (v1.3)

Paste ONE line to start. Recommended for single‑chat “deep extended thinking mode”.

## Option A: One‑chat research loop (recommended)
NO-MIGRATION. Bootstrap from the uploaded zip and start Deep intake. Then enable ONECHAT_LOOP=v1.3.

## Option B: Normal (legacy) locked execution
NO-MIGRATION. Bootstrap from the uploaded zip and start Deep intake.

## If resuming a prior locked session
MIGRATION-PASTED. Bootstrap + Deep intake. Then enable ONECHAT_LOOP=v1.3 (optional).

### Notes
- ONECHAT_LOOP is a **single conversation** protocol that emulates multi‑agent collaboration through strict phase gating.
- After the assistant outputs MODE_LOCK, reply `CONFIRM` to enter LOCKED stage.
- For fastest onboarding, open: `docs/ONBOARDING_FASTPATH_v1.3.md`.
